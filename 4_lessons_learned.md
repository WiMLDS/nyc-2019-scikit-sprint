# Lessons Learned

1.  Track the issues and PRs early on that attendees are working on.  It makes it easier for all of us.
2.  Perhaps collect people's emails and have them write what they are working on in the shared google doc.  (I know that when I receive many notifications from GH repo's, I can miss them.)
3.  Some people worked on PRs that were already open, but we don't have a way of tracking that.
4.  Extend sprint to 6pm.  10am to 3pm is too brief.
5.  Maybe ask participants to choose an issue beforehand and mark it on the spreadsheet.
6.  Possibly partner with advanced users such as developers.  Maybe we can progress farther?
7.  Follow up with attendees within a week after sprint to maintain momentum
8.  Communicate to attendees during the sprint if/how we would like them to complete their open PR
