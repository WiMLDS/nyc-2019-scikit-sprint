>Contributing to #scikitlearn , an #opensource #machinelearning library used by thousands of people around the world and knowing that something they see has been touched by you is pretty rewarding. Spent an entire day at the #WiMLDS sprint to get my first PR approved, & 2nd PR is on the way. Kudos to all the selfless contributors of all open source who spend years on something that I so easily use!
Thanks to my contributing partner Tian Tang for being so awesome.
Thank you Microsoft and Bloomberg LP for hosting the 24th August 2019 #NYC #Sprint. Kudos to hosts Reshama Shaikh and Nitya Narasimhan. Thanks to our Sklearn experts Andreas Mueller, Thomas J Fan, Nicolas Hug as well as all our #Bloomberg mentors for helping and guiding us patiently throughout the day.
