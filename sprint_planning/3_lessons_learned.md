# Lessons Learned

## 2018
1.  Track the issues and PRs early on that attendees are working on.  It makes it easier for all of us.
2.  Perhaps collect people's emails and have them write what they are working on in the shared google doc.  (I know that when I receive many notifications from GH repo's, I can miss them.)
3.  Some people worked on PRs that were already open, but we don't have a way of tracking that.
4.  Extend sprint to 6pm.  10am to 3pm is too brief.
5.  Maybe ask participants to choose an issue beforehand and mark it on the spreadsheet.
6.  Possibly partner with advanced users such as developers.  Maybe we can progress farther?
7.  Follow up with attendees within a week after sprint to maintain momentum
8.  Communicate to attendees during the sprint if/how we would like them to complete their open PR

## 2019
- 44 attendees too many.  reduce number of attendees to a manageable group
- do not have set deadline for applications.  make it rolling applications
- `conda install` instructions updated adding `conda-forge`
- do not promote sponsors until sponsorship funds have been received
- have people submit feedback survey at end of event
- using meetup glitches: some attendees do not join meetup group so don't receive communications

>Contributing to #scikitlearn , an #opensource #machinelearning library used by thousands of people around the world and knowing that something they see has been touched by you is pretty rewarding. Spent an entire day at the #WiMLDS sprint to get my first PR approved, & 2nd PR is on the way. Kudos to all the selfless contributors of all open source who spend years on something that I so easily use!
Thanks to my contributing partner Tian Tang for being so awesome.
